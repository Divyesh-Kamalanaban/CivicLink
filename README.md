# Civic Link: Abstract

**Civic Link** is a collaborative platform leveraging AI to revolutionize community problem-solving. It empowers the public to report issues with rich media and categorization, while connecting them with volunteers, NGOs, and corporations. An intelligent Civic Engine prioritizes problems based on AI analysis and community input, facilitating transparent CSR funding allocation to NGOs for resolution. The platform ensures accountability through multi-layered verification, including AI analysis, corporate on-site checks, and administrative review, with IoT monitoring for high-impact projects. Flexible participation allows problem posters to specify their preferred support (volunteers/NGOs), guided by AI suitability assessments. Secure authentication is managed via Google Sign-In. Civic Link fosters a dynamic ecosystem for effective civic engagement and community improvement.
